# Think Java

I will be going through the book, **Think Java**, second edition by **Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield**. This repository will contain my own solutions to the exercises found in the book.

I will be going through the book with **Ransom Uwakwem**, **Samson Olubiyi** and **Kelechukwu Cosibe**. We hope to go through each other's codes and learn a lesson or two. This study takes place in our discord server.
