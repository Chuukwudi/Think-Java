# Chapter One

## Exercise 1.1

1. A statement is a part of a program that specifies one step of an algorithm while a comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters. In java, comments begin with double forward slash <span style="color:red">&sol;&sol;</span>. Multiline coments begin with <span style="color:red">&sol;&ast;</span> and end with <span style="color:red">&ast;&sol;</span>.  <br/>

2. A program is portable if it can run on more than one kind of computer.  <br/>

3. Compile means to translate a program in a high-level language into a low-level
language, all at once, in preparation for later execution.  <br/>

4. An executable is another name for object code that is ready to run on specific
hardware.
